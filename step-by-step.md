Starting small with Zig is a great approach, especially since it will help you get comfortable with the language while giving you building blocks for a 2D game engine. Here’s a series of tiny exercises that ramp up step-by-step. These will lead you from foundational code skills into basic game engine concepts.

### Stage 1: **Foundation in Zig and Basics of Rendering**

1. **Hello World in Zig**  
   Write a simple program that prints “Hello, World!” to confirm your development environment is set up correctly.

2. **Simple Console Drawing**  
   Create a program that draws a simple shape (e.g., a square or triangle) in the console using `*` characters. This will reinforce basic loops and conditionals.

3. **Basic Window Setup (using SDL or GLFW)**  
   Set up a window with an external library like SDL or GLFW. This is a good point to start using Zig’s package manager to link these libraries.

4. **Draw a Pixel in a Window**  
   Expand the window program to draw a single pixel in the center of the screen. Adjust its color and confirm it’s working as expected.

### Stage 2: **Working with Simple 2D Graphics**

5. **Render a Rectangle**  
   Write a function to render a simple rectangle in the window. This will involve setting up a basic rendering loop and drawing to a framebuffer.

6. **Move the Rectangle (Basic Input Handling)**  
   Make the rectangle movable using keyboard input (e.g., arrow keys or WASD). This step introduces you to basic input handling.

7. **Implement a Simple Coordinate System**  
   Convert the pixel-based movement into a coordinate system, allowing you to move the rectangle at different scales or speeds. This will be useful for more abstract transformations later.

8. **Basic Animation Loop**  
   Set up a render loop that redraws the rectangle’s position every frame, giving the appearance of smooth movement. You could make the rectangle move automatically to get familiar with updating objects over time.

### Stage 3: **Creating Core Game Engine Concepts**

9. **Entity Structure**  
   Define a simple “Entity” struct with properties like position, velocity, and color. This structure can represent any game object, such as a player or enemy.

10. **Render Multiple Entities**  
    Create a list (array) of entities and render them in different positions and colors. This exercise builds your understanding of handling multiple objects and iterating over them in the render loop.

11. **Basic Collision Detection (AABB)**  
    Implement axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision detection between two entities. Use this for basic interactions between objects, like stopping movement upon collision.

12. **Basic Physics Update (Gravity)**  
    Introduce a gravity effect on entities by modifying their velocity each frame. You’ll see how an update loop affects gameplay and behavior over time.

### Stage 4: **User Interactions and Game Mechanics**

13. **Sprite Animation (Simple)**  
    Set up a basic sprite system to render different frames for an entity, animating it as it moves. You can start with a basic square that changes colors or shapes to represent frames.

14. **Health and Hit Detection**  
    Add a “health” property to your entities and create a function that reduces health on collision, showing a basic damage mechanic.

15. **Simple Input-Based Game Mechanics**  
    Create a shooting mechanic where the player can press a key to spawn a bullet entity that moves across the screen. This introduces basic projectile mechanics.

### Stage 5: **Developing the Game World**

16. **Tilemap Rendering**  
    Implement a tilemap system to draw a grid-based environment, useful for top-down or platformer games. Start with a small, static map to keep it simple.

17. **Camera and Viewport**  
    Set up a basic camera that follows the player as they move, rendering only part of the game world. This is a key concept for 2D games with larger maps.

18. **Basic Game Loop with State Management**  
    Implement a basic game state manager to handle different game states (e.g., Main Menu, Playing, Paused). This will help you keep the game organized as it grows.

19. **Sound Integration**  
    Integrate simple sound effects (like a beep or chime) on actions like shooting or collisions. Zig can interface with libraries like SDL for audio, or you can use a simpler sound library.

### Stage 6: **Refining the Engine Components**

20. **Component-Based Entities**  
    Refactor your entity structure to support a component-based system (e.g., an entity can have multiple components like Position, Velocity, Health). This is more complex but prepares your engine for flexibility and scalability.

21. **Basic Particle System**  
    Create a particle effect system, such as a small burst when the player shoots or an explosion on collision. Particles are typically simple entities with limited lifetimes and specific behaviors.

22. **Event System**  
    Implement an event system to manage actions like collisions, item pickups, or health depletion. This can be useful for decoupling game mechanics from entities.

By following this progression, you’ll end up with the foundations of a simple 2D game engine, and you’ll be more comfortable with Zig’s features. These exercises will help you create something modular and expandable, giving you a solid base to dive deeper into game engine development.
